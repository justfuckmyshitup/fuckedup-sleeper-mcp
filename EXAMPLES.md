# Sleeper MCP Server - Usage Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of how to use the Sleeper MCP Server with AI assistants.

**Example scope:** The inherited responses and conversations below are hypothetical illustrations, not recorded tool runs or verified reporting. IDs, seasons, scores, counts, player statuses, and team affiliations are sample values; use your actual identifiers and the requested season when calling tools. The news quotations attributed to ESPN and SF Chronicle and the 70% play estimate are unsupported sample text, not sourced quotations or a measured probability.

In the current implementation, `research_player_status` reads Sleeper player fields and returns mock `web_research` strings without making a web search. Lineup points and recommendations are rank/injury heuristics, not matchup forecasts. `get_waiver_suggestions` excludes players on your own roster but does not establish availability across all league rosters. For a feasible weekly workflow, retrieve your league and roster, confirm the week with `get_nfl_state`, inspect status and trend fields, then check current injury reporting and all league rosters before making a decision. See the [handlers](src/handlers.ts) for the implemented mechanics.

## Conversation Examples

### Fantasy Football Analysis Session

**User:** "Analyze my lineup for this week and tell me if I should make any changes"

2. Then analyze your current lineup
3. Check for any injured or questionable players
4. Look at trending players for potential pickups
5. Give you specific recommendations

**User:** "My username is 'fantasyguru2024'"

**AI uses tools:**
- `get_user_info` → Gets user_id
- `get_user_leagues` → Shows available leagues
- `analyze_lineup` → Reviews current starters/bench
- `research_player_status` → Checks injury status for questionable players
- `get_waiver_suggestions` → Finds potential replacements

**AI Response:**
"Based on your lineup analysis for Week 8:

✅ **Strong Starters:** Josh Allen (QB) and Tyreek Hill (WR) are must-starts
⚠️ **Monitor Closely:** Christian McCaffrey is Questionable - have Jordan Mason ready as backup
🔄 **Consider Changes:** Your FLEX spot could be upgraded

**Waiver Wire Recommendations:**
1. Jordan Mason (RB) - High priority handcuff for CMC
2. Romeo Doubs (WR) - Trending up with 5,240 recent adds

**Overall Grade: B+** - Solid lineup with minor adjustments needed"

### Weekly Matchup Preview

**User:** "Who am I playing against this week and how do our teams compare?"

**AI uses tools:**
- `get_matchup_details` → Gets opponent info
- `compare_players` → Compares key players
- `get_nfl_state` → Confirms current week

**AI Response:**
"You're facing **The Underdogs** this week (Week 8).

**Your Team (127.5 proj points):**
- QB: Josh Allen vs weak NYJ defense ✅
- RB: CMC (questionable) + Saquon Barkley
- WR: Tyreek Hill + CeeDee Lamb

**Their Team (112.3 proj points):**
- QB: Joe Burrow (tough matchup vs SF)
- RB: Josh Jacobs + Tony Pollard
- WR: Davante Adams + Mike Evans

**Key Matchups:**
- Your Josh Allen vs their Joe Burrow: Advantage YOU (better matchup)
- Their Mike Evans vs your CMC: Monitor CMC's status

**Prediction:** You're favored by 15.2 points, but watch CMC's injury status closely."

### Injury Research Deep Dive

**User:** "Christian McCaffrey is questionable again. Should I start him or play it safe?"

**AI uses tools:**
- `research_player_status` → Web search for latest news
- `get_player_details` → Current roster status
- `get_waiver_suggestions` → Backup options

**AI Response:**
"Here's the latest on Christian McCaffrey:

**Current Status:** Questionable with calf injury (limited practice Wednesday)

**Latest Reports:**
- ESPN: 'CMC participated in light drills but sat out contact portions'
- SF Chronicle: 'Coach Kyle Shanahan optimistic but will be game-time decision'
- Fantasy experts: 'Have Jordan Mason ready as pivot option'

**My Recommendation:**
🟡 **CAUTIOUS START** - Keep CMC in lineup BUT:
- Set Jordan Mason as your backup plan
- Monitor Friday injury report
- Check inactives list 90 minutes before kickoff

**Risk Assessment:** 70% chance he plays, but could be limited if he does play"
